lrtt parser -- can't remember what was bad

ohm - js, and awkward to use resutls. although awesome

teerex (from opalang) - doesn't support left-recursion

https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2010/12/29/packrat-parser-with-left-recursion/
- current try
- added (negative) lookahead
- no error messages though, want to add those
- also want grammar parsing, will work on that now
- also want the `lexical` vs `Nonlexical` distinction that ohm has. Ideal
  would be to be compatible w/ (a subset of) ohm's syntax
